Hello! My name is Hector, I am currently <Age/> years old and living in Toronto. I made this website with the intention of sharing things I'm working on, learning but also take writings and ideas sitting in my notebook's pages to bring them to the finish line.

This website was designed to be simple, performant and accessible; I explicitly avoided seeking completeness so I could sit down and finish something. This technique worked wonderfully and the result is this *awesome* post you're enjoying with cool fonts[^Inter-by-Rasmus][^Geist-Mono-by-Vercel] and a __cute__ logo!

I like computer science, making software & art, philosophy and literature. I would love to have more time to reflect and think deeper. These days, I work at [Frens](https://frens.lol) where I solve interesting problems and strive to create fascinating, useful tech for humans.

I currently want to understand how algebraic structures[^Example-of-a-Cool-One] relate to computer science and how I can use them to design constructs with *useful properties (e.g; interoperability)* and __strong guarantees (e.g; concurrency safety)__. On the philosophical side, I am passionate about [*The Rebel* by Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rebel_(book)) and the difficult questions it asks about political mode of actions, their necessity and inherent metaphysical tensions[^Camus-Tensions].

If you have any questions or want to get in touch, I would love to hear from you at scaramouuuuche+bldw@pm.me.

[^Camus-Tensions]: I liked [this article](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/#AbRebMur) from [Stanford's Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html) because it precisely delves into Camus' preoccupations throughout his life which gives important context to *The Rebel*.
